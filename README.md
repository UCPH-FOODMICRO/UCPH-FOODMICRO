# UCPH-FOODMICRO

Here we store and share bioinformatic and statical workflows for handling sequencing type data. 
For new scientist doing their first project analysing the micorbiome by sequencing, educational-like resources are distributed here. Likewise we also distribute new tools for the use by more experienced computational scientists.  

The educational resources are distributed between existing well working pipelines made by others, as well as our own inhouse costumized.
